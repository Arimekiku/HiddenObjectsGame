# Hidden Object Game
This is my test task on hidden object game.
## Rules
1. Use zenject and unirx;
2. Use addresables for sprite loading in scenes (On instantiating)
3. Implement currency (Coins, Star) and ability (Magnet, Compass) systems;
4. Implement save (Currency and Hidden objects \ Producers) system;
5. Implement UI popups on object collection;
6. Spawn another object of collected type after 10 seconds;

## Result
You can check the result by downloading project or check out the video:

## Weak points
1. Low flexibility in terms of adding new items;
2. Low flexibility in terms of adding new levels.

This prototype was made for unirx and zenject practice so there's some crucial weak points that cannot allow this prototype to evolve into a commercial game.

## Afterword
I really struggled on that one because of MVP architecture that i tried to follow and completely new approaches in unirx/zenject usings (Like factories or pools from zenject that i never used before).
But i managed to complete that little quest so you can check my project and give me a little review :)
